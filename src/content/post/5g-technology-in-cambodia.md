The introduction of 5G technology in Cambodia is scheduled for 2021. In order to support 5G networks, the Cambodian government and mobile service providers have been upgrading the nation's telecom infrastructure.

The Cambodian government has set a target of 2023 for the commercial rollout of 5G networks. In order to achieve this goal, the government has allocated 200 MHz of spectrum for 5G use. The government has also established a task force to oversee the development and deployment of 5G in Cambodia.

Several mobile operators in Cambodia have expressed interest in deploying 5G networks. Cellcard, Metfone, and Smart Axiata have all announced plans to launch 5G networks in 2023.

The rollout of 5G in Cambodia is expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy. 5G is expected to boost economic growth by creating new jobs, attracting foreign investment, and improving productivity. 5G is also expected to improve the quality of life for Cambodians by providing faster and more reliable internet access.

For both home and commercial users, the objective is to deliver quicker, more dependable, and wider internet access.

It is anticipated that the adoption of 5G would increase prospects for innovation and growth across a range of industries, including banking, healthcare, and education.

But there are obstacles to 5G technology development as well, including a shortage of infrastructure, financial resources, and experienced labor in the sector.

In 2019, Cellcard announced it's the first to launch real 5G trials in Cambodia, with speeds reaching 1.6Gbps.

What's 5G?

The newest mobile network technology, known as 5G, was created to connect anything and everyone, including machines, objects, and other gadgets. It provides higher reliability, more capacity, lower latency, faster speeds, and an enhanced user experience. With the help of 5G technology, new opportunities and industries are connected.

With peak data rates of up to 20 Gigabits per second (Gbps) and average data rates of more than 100 Megabits per second (Mbps), 5G is much faster than 4G.

### 5G in neighboring nation Thailand

Thailand is currently implementing 5G technology. The nation intends to modernize its current mobile network infrastructure so that it can accommodate 5G services and give people access to faster internet speeds, lower latency, and better connectivity. The Thai government is also collaborating with telecom firms to hasten the rollout of 5G networks throughout the nation.

Through the employment of cutting-edge 5G technologies, the goal is to transform Thailand into a digital hub in Southeast Asia and stimulate innovation and economic growth there.

Cambodia has a limited railway system, which is primarily used for transporting goods. The railway system in Cambodia is operated by the state-owned company Royal Railways of Cambodia (RRC).

The Cambodian railway system is not well-developed and infrastructure is not in good condition, as a result, it's not considered a reliable or efficient mode of transportation for passengers or cargo. However, the government has announced plans to improve and expand the railway system in the future to increase connectivity and boost economic growth.

**Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville**

The most active railway route in Cambodia is the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville route which was built to connect the capital city to the main port of the country. The journey takes around 6 hours and it is used mainly for freight transportation.

**Phnom Penh-Poipet**

This route connects Phnom Penh to the border town of Poipet and provides an alternative route to the busy National Road 5. It is also used mainly for freight transportation.

**Battambang-Poipet**

This route connects the city of Battambang to the border town of Poipet and is mainly used for freight transportation.

As tomorrow, I will head off to Battambang, I decide to try a new route. Instead of booking a bus or van ticket on BookMeBus, I choose to take a train this time. This is 2022. There is actually a train service in Cambodia. Have you ever heard of Cambodia Railway Station?

### Royal Railway Cambodia train ticket e-booking

You don't actually have to go to Cambodia Railyway Station to buy your train ticket. On [the Royal Railways website](http://royal-railway.com/?page=ebooking&lg=en) (available in both English and Khmer), you can check the train routes, schedules, and prices. It's nearly $10 for a one-way ticket from Phnom Penh to Battambang province. Currently there are two schedules each day. I chose the early morning departure. While the price is not much cheaper than taking a bus, the duration is a bit longer to arrive.

If you've got a Paypal account, that's the most secure way to pay for your train ticket. ABA or Acleda bank payment methods are not available. Only Wing Bank, which is owned by the same group company that runs the Cambodian train service.

You can subscribe to [Cambopedia on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cambopedia) for vidoes of the train journey.

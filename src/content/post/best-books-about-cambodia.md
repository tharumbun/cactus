### Kindling the love of reading among Khmer children in Cambodia

As a busy father of two kids, I always strive to find interesting and educational resources to keep them engaged in reading. One way I do this is by keeping up with the latest technology and reading my favorite tech news websites, long-form articles on Medium, and books. I also aim to instill the love of reading in my kids, and take advantage of opportunities like the annual National Reading Day in Cambodia to bring them to the book fair at the National Library in Phnom Penh.

Lucky for me, I have some tech-savvy friends who have introduced me to valuable resources for my kids' education. One of them recommended the Khmer KorKa Kids app, which teaches children basic Khmer alphabets, vowels, and consonants through artwork and audio. Another friend brought my attention to the Let's Read website, which offers a wealth of children's books in the Khmer language, available for easy download in both EPUB and PDF formats.

During my spare time, I like to browse the Let's Read website and download some ebooks for my kids to read over the weekend. I particularly appreciate the colorful illustrations and conversational stories, such as "ងូតទឹកភ្លៀង" or "Rain Shower", which features tips and advice in a fun and engaging way.

The convenience of modern technology is something I cannot ignore. With a fast Fiber internet connection at home and mobile internet access on-the-go, I have unlimited access to information and resources for my kids' education. I recall the days when I had to go to an Internet café to write and read, but now, with mobile internet readily available, the possibilities are endless.

For parents, it's crucial to stay informed about useful and educational online resources and apps for kids, and I am grateful for the opportunities technology provides for my children's learning and growth.

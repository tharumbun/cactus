There are several services available you can check out. Some are more costly than the others. Trust and secure are what most people are looking for.

There are several ways to send money to Cambodia, including:

**Bank wire transfer**

Many banks offer international wire transfer services, which can be used to send money to Cambodia. This method is generally reliable, but can be expensive due to high fees. You can send money to Cambodia through a bank transfer. You'll need to provide the recipient's bank account details, including the account name, number, and bank name. It's also essential to check the exchange rates and transfer fees charged by the banks.

**Online money transfer services**

Companies such as Western Union, MoneyGram, and Ria offer online money transfer services, which can be used to send money to Cambodia. These services are generally faster and more affordable than bank wire transfers, but fees can still be relatively high. You can also use online money transfer services like TransferWise, PayPal, WorldRemit, and others to send money to Cambodia. These services often have lower fees and offer competitive exchange rates.

1. PayPal: PayPal is widely accepted in Cambodia, and many merchants and businesses accept PayPal as a form of payment. If you have a PayPal account, you can send money to Cambodia by sending it to a recipient's PayPal account.
2. Bitcoin: Bitcoin is a digital currency that can be used to send money to Cambodia. This method is fast, secure and has low transaction fees, but it is not yet widely used and accepted in Cambodia, so it's not a very common way to send money.

When sending money to Cambodia, it is important to compare fees and exchange rates from different providers before choosing a method, and to make sure that the recipient has a bank account or mobile phone to receive the money.

### Payoneer

I've used Payoneer for several years. It's one of the easiest way to get your payment deposit in your local Cambodian bank account. The fee has been increased quite a bit since the pandemic. Payoneer is a favorite choice among Cambodia-based freelancers.

### Wise

Formerly WiseTransfer, this online service makes transfer money abroad easily and quickly with its low cost money transfers. There are many choices of currencies available.

The good news is that starting in 2022 that Wise has become available for a country like Cambodia. [To create a Wise account is quick and easy](https://wise.com/invite/u/tharumb). You may want to connect to your Cambodian bank debit card or not is up to you.

Wise is a popular online platform for money transfers because it offers several benefits over traditional banks, including:

1. Lower fees: Wise typically charges lower fees compared to banks, especially for international transfers.
2. Better exchange rates: Wise uses the mid-market exchange rate, which is the real exchange rate, to transfer money between countries. This results in better exchange rates compared to banks who often add a markup to the exchange rate.
3. Faster transfers: Wise can process transfers quickly, often within one to two business days.
4. Convenient and easy to use: The Wise platform is easy to use and can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.
5. Secure: Wise uses advanced security measures to protect users' funds and personal information.

Overall, the combination of lower fees, better exchange rates, faster transfers, convenience, and security make Wise a great choice for people who need to transfer money.

### Paypal

Is PayPal used in Cambodia?

PayPal is available in Cambodia, but with limited functionality. You can use PayPal to send and receive money from other PayPal users in Cambodia, but you cannot use it to withdraw money from your PayPal account to a Cambodian bank account. You can also use PayPal to shop online at merchants that accept PayPal, but you may be subject to additional fees.

If you need to withdraw money from your PayPal account to a Cambodian bank account, you can use a third-party service like Wise or Transferwise. These services allow you to transfer money between different countries at a lower cost than PayPal.

If you are planning to use PayPal in Cambodia, it is important to be aware of the limitations and fees involved.

The good thing is anyone in Cambodia can have a Paypal account to send money. Unfortunately, Paypal has not added Cambodia to list of countries with the capability to receive money.

So, Cambodia's Paypal users can only send or transfer money, but they cannot receive money through their Paypal yet. While it's usually safe and secure to transfer money from Cambodia to abroad through a bank, Paypal is also a way that most Cambodians use.

### Money transfer through bank in Cambodia

Phnom Penh, the capital and largest city of Cambodia, has a rich history and culture that has been captured in a variety of literature. These books are not only focusing on Phnom Penh, but also Cambodia's history, culture, and its people experience during war and complex time. They offer a deep understanding and insight of the place and its people.

### Five must-read books that provide an in-depth look at Phnom Penh and its people:

1. "When Broken Glass Floats: Growing Up Under the Khmer Rouge" by Chanrithy Him: This memoir tells the story of a young girl's life during the Khmer Rouge regime and its aftermath. It gives a powerful and personal account of the devastation and trauma that the Cambodian people endured during this period, and the resilience and strength they demonstrated in overcoming it.
2. "First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers" by Loung Ung: This memoir tells the author's story of survival during the Khmer Rouge period, when an estimated 1.5 million Cambodians died from starvation, disease, or execution.
3. "The Gate" by François Bizot: This memoir tells the story of French anthropologist François Bizot's experiences during the Khmer Rouge period, including his capture by the Khmer Rouge and his interactions with their leader, Pol Pot.
4. "Phnom Penh: A Cultural and Literary History" by John Tully: This book provides an overview of Phnom Penh's history and culture from its foundation in the 14th century to the present day. It explores the city's literary and intellectual heritage, as well as its role in shaping modern Cambodia.
5. "Phnom Penh Noir" edited by Christopher G. Moore: This is a collection of short stories by various authors set in Phnom Penh. it explores the darker side of the city, giving readers a sense of the crime, corruption, and complexity of modern-day Phnom Penh through fiction.

Since its foundation in 1372, Phnom Penh is uniquely known for its historical architecture and great attractions. Many centuries later, there are more and more books written about this city (aka Paris of the East or even the Pearl of Asia). There are reasons for those nicknames. Written mostly by those who fell in love with the city, I also picked some Phnom Penh books authored by Cambodian writers.

Bou Samnang is a Cambodian long-distance runner who competed in the women's 5000 meters at the 2023 Southeast Asian Games. She finished last in the race, but her determination and perseverance in the face of adversity won her the hearts of fans around the world.

The New York Times's headline says: [This Runner Finished Last, but Her Perseverance Won Over a Nation](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/sports/bou-samnang-cambodian-runner-rain.html).

Samnang was born in a small village in rural Cambodia. She started running at a young age, and she quickly showed a natural talent for the sport. However, she came from a poor family, and she did not have the resources to train or compete at a high level.

In 2023, Samnang was selected to represent Cambodia at the Southeast Asian Games. The games were held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Samnang was one of the country's top medal hopes. However, the weather turned bad on the day of the 5000 meters race, and it began to rain heavily.

The rain made the track slippery and difficult to run on. Samnang was also hampered by a lack of experience, and she quickly fell behind the leaders. However, she refused to give up. She kept running, even as the rain poured down and the wind whipped her hair around her face.

Samnang eventually finished the race, but she came in last place. However, her determination and perseverance inspired fans around the world. She was praised for her courage and her refusal to give up, and she became a symbol of hope for Cambodia.

After the games, Samnang was awarded a $10,000 bonus by the Cambodian government. She also received a scholarship to study at a university in Phnom Penh. Samnang plans to continue running, and she hopes to one day compete in the Olympics.

Samnang's story is an inspiration to us all. She shows us that anything is possible if we set our minds to it. She also shows us that it is important to never give up, no matter what challenges we face.

At the closing ceremony of the SEA Games, the first held in Cambodia in 64 years, Samnang was one of the spotlights to represent her nation.

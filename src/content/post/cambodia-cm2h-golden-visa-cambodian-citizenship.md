Have you ever considered living in Cambodia? Perhaps you've visited the country and fell in love with its natural beauty, warm weather, and friendly locals. Or maybe you're drawn to the low cost of living and the opportunity to invest in a growing economy.

Whatever your reasons, if you're looking for a long-term stay in Cambodia, the Cambodia My 2nd Home (CM2H) program may be of interest to you. This is the only official government program approved and recognized by the Ministry of Interior and General Department of Immigration of the Kingdom of Cambodia that allows foreigners to stay in Cambodia with a Golden Visa of 10 years.

With the CM2H program, successful applicants can enjoy a range of benefits, including the ability to apply for a Cambodian passport after just 5 years. This is the only official pathway to apply for a Cambodian passport in Cambodia.

The CM2H program is open to all countries recognized by Cambodia, with certain investment and financial requirements. These requirements vary depending on the type of investment you plan to make, but generally involve investing in real estate, establishing a business, or making a deposit in a local bank.

Perhaps the best part of the CM2H program is that successful applicants do not have any entry or exit restrictions in Cambodia. This means you're free to come and go as you please, without the need for visas or extensions.

Overall, the CM2H program offers a unique opportunity for foreigners who are interested in making Cambodia their second home. With its range of benefits and relatively low investment requirements, it's worth considering if you're looking for a long-term stay in this beautiful and welcoming country.

### The advantages of the Cambodia My 2nd Home (CM2H) Golden Visa program

Foreigners who hold a CM2H visa can now obtain Cambodian citizenship after just five years, making it the only official pathway to citizenship recognized by the Cambodian government. This is a unique opportunity for those who wish to establish Cambodia as their second home and enjoy all the benefits that come with it.

In addition to the citizenship pathway, CM2H visa holders are also entitled to free professional assistance for their personal and work-related matters in the country through the Khmer Home Charity Association (KHCA). This includes assistance with company incorporation, opening bank accounts, establishing trusts, and obtaining a Cambodian driver's license, among other things.

Moreover, the CM2H program offers several other privileges, such as one-year free medical insurance in Cambodia and VIP access at Cambodian airports. These privileges are aimed at making the visa holders' stay in Cambodia more comfortable and enjoyable.

Cambodia also has a direct citizenship by investment program, which is another option for those who wish to obtain Cambodian citizenship. However, the CM2H program offers several benefits that the citizenship by investment program does not, such as free professional assistance and a lower investment threshold.

Overall, the CM2H program is an excellent option for those who wish to live in Cambodia long-term and enjoy all the benefits that come with it. With the official pathway to citizenship, free professional assistance, and other privileges, the CM2H program is an excellent opportunity that should not be missed.

Here are some of San Sochea's teachings on peace and reconciliation:

"Peace is not something you buy, earn, or demand. Peace comes from within." "Reconciliation is not about forgetting the past. It is about learning to live with the past in a way that does not destroy the present." "The greatest gift we can give to others is our forgiveness."

San Sochea's work is a reminder that peace and reconciliation are possible, even in the most difficult of circumstances. His teachings offer hope to all who are seeking a better world.

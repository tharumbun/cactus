Cambodia has a relatively small news media landscape. The majority of news media in Cambodia is privately owned, with a few state-owned outlets as well. These newspapers are available in print and online, and provide coverage of local and national news, as well as international events. There are also a number of online news sites that offer a mix of news and opinion pieces.

Despite the existence of private news media, many journalists in Cambodia face challenges when reporting on sensitive issues. The government also controls the broadcast media, which includes a number of TV and radio stations.

Overall, the news media in Cambodia faces significant challenges, including government interference, low levels of press freedom, and financial constraints. Despite these challenges, however, journalists in Cambodia continue to work to bring important stories to light and to hold those in power accountable.

### The impact of social media on journalism in Cambodia

In recent years, the rise of social media has had a significant impact on journalism in Cambodia. On one hand, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have allowed journalists to disseminate information quickly and effectively to a wider audience than ever before. This has been particularly important in a country like Cambodia, where traditional media outlets are often censored or controlled by the government.

However, social media has also brought its own set of challenges for journalists. With the proliferation of fake news and disinformation online, it can be difficult for journalists to separate fact from fiction and ensure that their reporting is accurate and reliable. In addition, social media can be used as a tool to harass or intimidate journalists who are critical of the government or other powerful entities.

Despite these challenges, many journalists in Cambodia continue to use social media as an important tool for their work. Some have even found ways to leverage social media to build networks of sources and collaborators outside of traditional media channels. As the landscape of journalism continues to evolve in Cambodia, it will be interesting to see how social media continues to shape the industry - both positively and negatively.

### Social media: alternative news sources

Social media has emerged as an important tool for news dissemination and public debate in Cambodia. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are widely used, particularly among younger Cambodians, to share news and express opinions. However, the government has also been known to crack down on social media users who criticize the government.

### What news and information people in Cambodia love to consume?

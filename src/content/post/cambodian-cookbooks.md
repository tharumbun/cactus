Khmer cuisine is the traditional cuisine of the Cambodian people. It is similar to Thai and Vietnamese cuisine, with a heavy emphasis on rice, seafood, and a variety of herbs and spices. Some popular dishes include Amok, a traditional fish curry, and Lok lak, a dish of marinated beef or pork served with vegetables and rice. Visitors to Cambodia should also try the street food, which offers a wide variety of delicious and inexpensive options. When eating out in Cambodia, it's important to be aware that many restaurants use a lot of MSG in their cooking, so if you're sensitive to it, it's best to ask that it not be used.

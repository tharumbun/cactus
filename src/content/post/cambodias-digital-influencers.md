A digital influencer is someone who makes stuff online (like videos or posts) and has a lot of people who like and trust them. Because of that, when they recommend a product or service, their followers might be more likely to buy it.

These influencers are all popular for different reasons, but they all have one thing in common: they use their platforms to connect with their followers and share their passions with the world. But keep in mind that popularity can vary depending on different factors such as the type of content, audience demographics, and engagement levels.

### Phnom Penh's coffee shops with fast Internet (recommended)

#### Starbuck

Does Cambodia have Starbucks? Starbucks Reserve BKK Flagship Store in the place you should check out.

#### Temple Cafe

It's another cafe for business meeting. Inside, you'll be amazed by its vintage design.

#### Odom Garden

is changing the way most Cambodians think about a coffee shop. It's a complete outdoor, open space cafe located in the heart of Phnom Penh. As the city is getting crowded, this is one of a few or the first of its kind. On Norodom Boulevard, just opposite to Chip Mong's Noro Mall, Odom Garden is a nice place for a lunch and coffee meeting with your business partners or taking your kids to get some natural lights.

#### Enso Cafe

Whether you want to work and relax indoor or outdoor, this is one of the most work-friendly café just a few minute walk from the Royal Palace. They also serve my favorite cold brew coffee. The staff are friendly.

#### Noir TK

The wifi is ultra fast. The second floor is place to hide yourself from the bustling Phnom Penh. I highly recommend this cafe if you want a place to work. The coffee is good enough for most people. It's not Starbucks. It's not Brown. It's Noir coffee. With this high-speed Internet package, this is how these Phnom Penh’s favorite remote workplaces can accommodate the growing number of freelancers, university students, and business people.

#### Brown Coffee and Bakery

The king of the local brand coffee chain, Brown has nearly 20 shops, most of them in Phnom Penh, with new expansion in Siem Reap. I like Brown’s cold brew coffee, which is only available at its roastery shop. The latest Brown Coffee roastery shop is located in Tuol Kork district. It’s one of Brown’s grand store with a small playground in its backyard.

Toul Kork is Phnom Penh’s newest shopping district

An open air shopping area where you can buy Adidas shoes and sip Brown coffee. When you crave for fast food, you can quickly order a slice of pizza or grab some sandwiches at Bread Talk and head straight to the cinema a few walks away. The Lucky Supermarket is also there, where busy residents come buy groceries and vegetables to cook at home. In addition to shopping at the TK Avenue, the Toul Kork residents also have many other choices. The Thai Huot Market is just quick drive from the Toul Kork roundabout. There is also an in Toul Kork district. In 2017, the district also has a new, convenient AEON Maxvalu as well as a new Bayon Supermarket.

Living in Toul Kork, you also have many choices for good coffee shops to hang out as if you're in Beung Keng Kang 1 area. Until now, there is no Starbucks Coffee shop in Toul Kork neighborhood just yet, but it's just a matter of time. Local chain Brown Coffee is at TK Avenue. American franchise Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is just around the corner.

Starting in 2021, there are more new apartments, condominiums, and shopping venues than ever.

#### The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf

There are at least 2 locations in Phnom Penh I’ve checked in. One thing that set this American coffee chain from Starbuck coffee store is that it offers unlimited Internet. Unlimited bandwidth and access duration. The world’s second-largest chain of coffee retailers after Starbuck’s, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf doesn’t seem to really have many stores, but each of its locations is very strategic. The other one I’ve tasted its Americano is on the ground floor of Phnom Penh Tower, one of the city’s tallest building known for its Eclypse Sky Bar.

#### Gloria Jean's Coffees

In a crowded market for coffee chains in Phnom Penh, this Australian chains usually has this creative campaign called Together Is Better. Gloria Jean's Coffees Cambodia’s stores can offer much more than coffee. In March 2017, the coffee shops partnered with Internet provider SINET to provide: good coffee + dedicated Internet, which is available at its store in BKK1 (Corner St 51 & St 310), Riverside Phnom Penh Port, Toul Kork (St 592), and Aeon mega mall.

#### Urban Space Playground & Café in Phnom Penh

Work & play? There is a place for that in Phnom Penh. I really like this place as it's a kid-friendly cafe in the city. It's called the Urban Space Playground & Café in Phnom Penh. You can do your work over the laptop and coffee and you kids can enjoy their play time in a space designed just for that.

I've been there for a couple of time just ahead of its official opening, so there an entry free for the children. A new, welcoming addition to Tuol Kork district is Urban Space Playground & Café. This Phnom Penh's latest playground plus cafe is the best of both worlds for parents and children.

There are a lot of coffee shops in Tuol Kork district. To name a few: Brown Coffee, Starbucks TK Avenue, Tea Leaf and Coffee Bean, Java Cafe, and Joma. In Tuol Kork alone, there are two Brown Coffee shops. The Brown Coffee Roastery Tuol Kork is larger than the one in TK Avenue and features an outside space for small kids. Urban Space Playground & Café is unique in this regard. A cafe, a workplace, and a playground in one.

I like this place because the playground has a small swimming pool designed for little kids. Next to the pool is a sandbox. On top of the cafe, the first floor is dedicated to kids, too. A climbing wall, a space for Lego, toys, drawing, and puzzles.

Tuol Kouk district is becoming an ideal place to live despite its distance from the riverside and Beung Keng Kang 1. Some great coffee outlets you can think of: Brown TK, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Java Cafe, and Joma Cafe.

It's also a nice place for freelancers and consultants to get their work done.

#### Good to Know

In Phnom Penh, more and more cafés compete by offering better in-shop experience, in addition to brewing the best cup of coffee for their customers. According to the Cambodia Investor Club, there are about 200 coffees shops in Phnom Penh as of mid 2017.

Cambodia has reported cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) since early 2020. The government has implemented measures to control the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, and mask mandates.

Throughout the pandemic, Cambodia has generally had relatively low numbers of confirmed cases and deaths compared to other countries. The government has also been successful in containing outbreaks and limiting community spread. However, the situation is constantly changing, so it is important to stay informed about the latest developments and follow any health and safety guidelines put in place by the government.

It is important to note that the situation of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) is constantly evolving, and the measures and restrictions implemented by governments can change rapidly. It is recommended to check the official website of the Ministry of Health of Cambodia or the World Health Organization for the most up-to-date information and guidelines.

> PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — The feel-good story of how Cambodia allowed a cruise ship to dock after it was turned away elsewhere in Asia for fear of spreading a new disease took an unfortunate turn after a passenger later tested positive for the virus.News over the weekend that an 83-year-old American woman who was on the ship and flew from Cambodia to Malaysia was found to be carrying the virus froze further movement of the passengers and crew of the Westerdam. Some are in hotels in Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, while others are still aboard the ship.

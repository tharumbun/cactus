Healthcare in Cambodia is a significant challenge, particularly in rural areas. The country has a population of over 16 million people, and the healthcare system is underfunded and understaffed.

The government provides some healthcare services, but the majority of healthcare is provided by private providers. The quality of care can be variable, and many Cambodians struggle to afford the cost of healthcare.

The main challenges for the healthcare system in Cambodia include:

1. Lack of infrastructure: Many rural areas lack basic medical facilities and trained healthcare workers.
2. Shortage of medical staff: There is a shortage of trained medical staff, particularly in rural areas.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Many Cambodians, particularly those living in rural areas, struggle to access healthcare due to cost and lack of transportation.
4. Lack of healthcare insurance: The majority of Cambodians do not have health insurance, making it difficult for them to afford the cost of healthcare.
5. Lack of coordination: The healthcare system in Cambodia is fragmented, and there is a lack of coordination between different levels of care.

The government of Cambodia has been taking steps to improve healthcare in the country, including increasing funding for healthcare and training more healthcare workers. However, much more needs to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system in Cambodia.

Cambodia has a developing healthcare system, with a mix of both public and private hospitals available. However, the quality and availability of healthcare services can vary widely depending on the location and the facility. Here are five of the best hospitals in Cambodia:

### Getting a life and health insurance in Cambodia

Cambodia started to have product offerings of life insurance in 2012. The best way to decide which insurance company to go for is by selecting several choices based on your preferable criteria. However, it's also important to insurance company history, track of records, and reputation.

This blog post is about everything you need to know about getting a life insurance in Cambodia. Unlike 5 years ago, you can now have more competitive choices for your life and health insurance coverage for both expats and Cambodians. After weeks of my comprehensive research, here's the list of the insurance providers operating (with a variety of offerings) in Cambodia. According to the Insurance Association of Cambodia, there are 27 member companies, 11 of them are licensed general insurers, 7 life insurers, 8 micro insurances and 1 reinsurer operating in Cambodia. In this blog post, you'll be able to learn and compare the life insurance for expats in Cambodia.

Life insurance is something to most Cambodians. However, the adoption of among young Cambodian middle class means that most insurance companies (local and international) will have to offer competitive offerings and services. For instance, Dai-ichi Life Holdings will be the first Japanese company to enter this competitive market after its success in Vietnam (acquired by Bao Minh CMG Life Insurance) and Thailand.

Hong Kong's AIA Cambodia is now one of the first life insurance companies that provides critical illness to Cambodian clients.

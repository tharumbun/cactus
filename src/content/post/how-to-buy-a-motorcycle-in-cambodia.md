If you're interested in buying a motorcycle in Cambodia, here are the steps you need to follow:

Research: Start by researching the different types of motorcycles available in Cambodia, their prices, and the dealerships that sell them. You can also ask for recommendations from friends or expat communities in Phnom Penh.

Budget: Decide on your budget and determine how much you are willing to spend on a motorcycle. Keep in mind that the cost of insurance, maintenance, and licensing should also be taken into consideration.

Visit dealerships: Visit several dealerships to see the motorcycles in person and test-ride them if possible. Compare prices and make a list of the motorcycles that fit your budget and needs.

Negotiate the price: Once you have found the motorcycle you want, negotiate the price with the dealership. Keep in mind that the prices in Cambodia are often negotiable, especially for used motorcycles.

Check the documents: Before you make a final purchase, make sure to check the motorcycle's documents to verify that it is in good condition and that it has a clear title.

Get insurance: It is mandatory to have insurance for your motorcycle in Cambodia. You can purchase insurance from the dealership or from a private insurance company.

Register the motorcycle: Finally, you will need to register the motorcycle with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport. You will need to provide proof of ownership, a passport or ID, and pay a registration fee.

Remember to take your time when buying a motorcycle in Cambodia, and to be cautious of any offers that seem too good to be true. It's important to make an informed decision to ensure that you have a safe and reliable motorcycle for your travels in Cambodia.

### Getting a Motorcycle in Cambodia

If you're a fan of Honda Super Cub, you can easily find a good, reliable one in Phnom Penh, which is home to many Japanese motorcycle shops and depots. In Phnom Penh, there are several Japanese motorcycle warehouses you should check out, including:

1. Motorcycles from Japan
2. Sakura Motor Shop
3. Arigato Cambodia
4. Lee Auto
5. Japanese Motorbikes CKH
6. FUJIMA Corporation

Most of the 50cc Super Cub motorcycle prices start at $500, depending on the condition of the bike. Before visiting a motorcycle shop, it's advisable to check its presence online, as most shops have their Facebook Page with latest photos and live videos. You can compare prices and negotiate before going there to see the motorcycle you want.

If you have a friend with in-depth knowledge of second-hand motorcycles, it's a great advantage to help you select the best one. These shops are reputable in Cambodia, and you can expect to get the most genuine spare parts for the motorcycle you're buying.

After purchasing a used Japanese motorcycle from a Phnom Penh shop, you'll receive a tax paper, which is an official document for registering the plate number and making the motorcycle legal on the road.

A Honda Super Cub motorcycle is affordable for most Phnom Penh residents and is easy and low cost to maintain, with many spare parts available for replacement. Additionally, after years of use, you can sell it without losing much, compared to other new, expensive bikes.

I personally recommend a Super Cub instead of other motorcycles because it's a great brand name from the Japanese maker, and I like the older editions made in the 1960s and 70s.

The origins of Kun Khmer can be traced back to ancient Cambodia, where it was known as "Pradal Serey." This martial art was developed by the Khmer people as a way to defend themselves against invaders and was used by the military to train soldiers. The sport was also used as a form of entertainment and was often performed at festivals and religious ceremonies.

The training regimen for Kun Khmer fighters typically includes a combination of cardio, strength training, and technique training. The fighters also undergo a rigorous diet and weight-cutting regimen to prepare for a match.

One of the unique aspects of Kun Khmer is the use of clinching and grappling techniques. These techniques are used to control an opponent, and to set up strikes with the hands, feet, elbows, and knees. This makes Kun Khmer a well-rounded and versatile martial art, as it combines striking and grappling techniques.

The sport is typically fought in a ring, with rounds lasting for three minutes each. The objective of a match is to knock out the opponent, or to score points by landing strikes and controlling the clinch. The fighters wear traditional Cambodian boxing shorts, headbands, and armbands, which are believed to offer protection and good luck.

Kun Khmer has a strong cultural significance in Cambodia, and it is deeply ingrained in the country's history and identity. The sport is seen as a symbol of national pride and is often used as a way to promote Cambodian culture and heritage. This is why it is not only a sport but also a cultural tradition.

Despite its rich history and cultural significance, Kun Khmer has struggled to gain international recognition. This is due in part to the lack of resources and support for the sport, as well as the lack of international exposure. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in Kun Khmer, and more and more fighters are competing in international competitions and events.

Both sports have a cultural and historical significance for the country of origin.

The traditional martial art and combat sport has a rich history and cultural significance in the Cambodian kingdom. A physically demanding sport, it requires a high level of fitness and conditioning and combines striking and grappling techniques. Despite the lack of resources and support, the sport is gaining popularity and recognition on an international level.

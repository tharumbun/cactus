3. Transportation: Taxis and tuk-tuks are widely available in the major cities, but it's best to negotiate the fare before starting the journey. Buses and flights are also available for travel to other parts of the country.
4. Safety: Cambodia is generally considered safe for travelers, but it's best to exercise caution when traveling to remote areas and to be aware of pickpocketing and other petty crimes.
5. Language: The official language is Khmer, but many people also speak English, especially in the major cities and tourist areas.

### Is Cambodia safe country to live?

Cambodia is generally considered safe for tourists and expatriates to visit, but it's worth noting that crime and safety can vary depending on the location and time. In general, crime rates are low, but pickpocketing, bag/phone snatching (even from a Tuk Tuk) and other petty crimes can be a concern in tourist areas. It's important to be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded areas and at night.

However, the political situation in the country is not stable and protests and demonstrations are common, especially in the capital, Phnom Penh. These protests can sometimes turn violent and it's important to avoid them.

It's also worth noting that some areas in Cambodia are affected by landmines, which are remnants of the country's past conflicts. These areas are generally well-marked, but visitors should exercise caution and stick to main roads and well-trodden paths.

In general, if you are planning to live in Cambodia, it's important to be aware of the potential risks and take steps to stay safe. This includes familiarizing yourself with local laws and customs, being aware of your surroundings, and staying informed about any potential security risks.

It's always a good idea to check the [U.S. Department of State website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/cambodia-travel-advisory.html) or the government website of your country for the most up-to-date information on safety and security in Cambodia before planning a trip or move there.

### Moving to and living in Cambodia?

**5 potential reasons someone might consider moving to Cambodia:**

1. Cost of Living: Cambodia is known for being one of the most affordable countries in Southeast Asia. The cost of living is significantly lower than in many developed countries, which can make it a great option for retirees, digital nomads, or others looking to stretch their budget.

2. Friendly People: Cambodians are known for being friendly and hospitable towards foreigners. The culture is generally laid-back, and people are happy to help newcomers adjust to life in the country.

3. Natural Beauty: Cambodia is home to some of the most beautiful landscapes in Southeast Asia. From the lush jungles in the east to the pristine beaches in the south, there is plenty to explore and enjoy.

4. Rich Culture: Cambodia has a rich and storied culture, with a long history dating back to the Angkor era. The country is home to many ancient temples and other historic sites, and traditional Khmer culture is still very much alive and celebrated today.

5. Growing Economy: Cambodia's economy has been growing rapidly in recent years, driven by a combination of tourism, manufacturing, and services sectors. This has created new job opportunities and business opportunities for those looking to move to the country.

It's worth noting that as with any country, living in Cambodia may have its own set of challenges, such as language barriers, limited infrastructure, and cultural differences. But for those who are open to new experiences and willing to adapt, Cambodia can be an incredibly rewarding place to live.

**Q: What is visiting Cambodia like?**

Food and housing are essential costs of living in Cambodia. If you choose to live in the heart of the capital city of Phnom Penh, $800 per month is approximately a good enough budget. If you move a bit further away (but not too far), you can spend just half of that ($400–600), maybe in the Sen Sok district.

For good enough food, $200–$250 per month should suffice.

Siem Reap, Cambodia is internationally known for its temples of Angkor, where you can have a breathtaking view of the sunset from the top of Phnom Bakheng.

Khmer People Are Super Friendly in Asia

Cambodians are the most friendly people in Asia. Khmer people are very hospitable. If you receive a formal or informal invitation to visit their home, consider yourself very fortunate because Khmer people consider you a nice person. In the urban cities like Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, or Sihanoukville, most Cambodians are able to have a conversation with you in English.

Cambodia's tourism: the backbone of the economy

The tourism industry is the second largest source of the country's hard currency, after the textile industry. Between January and December 2007, there were 2.0 million arrivals, an increase of 18.5% from the same time period in 2006. Most tourists traveled through Siem Reap (49%), followed by Phnom Penh and other destinations. Other popular destinations include Sihanoukville in the east, which has a beach resort, and the area near Kampot and Kep, including Bokor Station. Tourism has increased steadily each year during a stable period, compared to the 118,183 international tourists in 1993 and the 2,161,577 international tourists in 2009.

**Q: What things should you do and see when you travel to Cambodia?**

One of the best things to do when visiting Cambodia is to get to know the local people, who are typically friendly and kind. Getting to know Cambodians personally allows you to learn about Cambodia in a way that you don't find in a travel guide book. A must-visit destination is Angkor Wat and the many other ancient temples in Siem Reap.

**Q: When is the best time to visit Cambodia?**

The best time to visit Cambodia is from November to March, as this is the dry season. April is the hottest month of the year, although Cambodians celebrate the Khmer New Year during this time.

In December, the weather is typically dry, sunny, with low humidity and cool temperatures (average temperature: 26°C) throughout the country. Not surprisingly, December is one of the most popular months to travel to Cambodia.

**Q: What are the best islands in Cambodia?**

Both Koh Rong and Koh Rong Sanloem (as recommended by Lonely Planet writer Jessica Lee) are located on the south coast of Cambodia. In Sihanoukville or Kampong Som alone, there are nearly 20 islands. However, these two islands, Koh Rong and Koh Rong Sanloem, have been praised by travelers for their cleanliness, beauty, and serenity. Another good choice that is closer to Phnom Penh is Rabbit Island (Koh Tonsay).

**Khmer music**

There is no better way to get into Cambodian culture than through Khmer music, which is a part of Cambodian daily life. Cambodian legendary singer Sin Sisamouth is often referred to as the "Elvis Presley" of Cambodia. In this blog post, you can find some selected YouTube music videos to listen to.

[Getting a job in Cambodia?](https://cambopedia.com/cambodia-job-websites/)

Logistics in Cambodia can be challenging due to a variety of factors, including poor infrastructure, underdeveloped transportation systems, and a lack of skilled labor. However, the country has made significant progress in recent years to improve its logistics capabilities. Here are a few key points to consider when discussing logistics in Cambodia:

**Transportation**

The main means of transportation in Cambodia is by road, but the road network is not well-developed and can be in poor condition. Additionally, there is a limited railway system and a small number of airports. This makes it difficult to move goods efficiently within the country.

**Ports**

The main port in Cambodia is Sihanoukville Port, which handles the majority of Cambodia's imports and exports. However, the port is facing capacity constraints and has limited infrastructure, which can slow down the movement of goods.

**Customs clearance**

The process of customs clearance in Cambodia can be time-consuming and bureaucratic. This is due to a lack of automation, inadequate training and a shortage of customs officials. This can cause delays in the clearance of goods.

**Logistics providers**

There are a number of logistics providers in Cambodia, but they are generally small and lack the resources and expertise of larger companies. As a result, they may not be able to handle large or complex logistics projects.

**Government initiatives**

The government of Cambodia has been making efforts to improve logistics in the country by investing in transportation infrastructure and streamlining customs procedures. It also aims to increase the number of logistics providers and to improve the skills of logistics workers to make the sector more competitive.

Overall, logistics in Cambodia is still a developing sector, and it still has a lot of room for improvement. However, in recent years, the country has been making progress to address its logistics challenges.

### How to Get a Cambodian Passport (for Cambodian Nationals)

Getting a new Cambodian passport is easier now for Khmer nationals. As time goes by, the administration services have been improved significantly. New to the Phnom Penhers is that it's very convenient to apply for a new passport, issued by the Ministry of Interior, inside the AEON mall 2 in Sen Sok district. This location of the passport office is more convenient than the one near the Niroth Pagoda.

To obtain a normal passport, it takes only 2 weeks, down from one month-long. It's stated on the wall that it's only $100, not $130 or $140. Starting since 2014, the Cambodian government adopted the new biometric passport (valid for 10 years). The table below shows the price ranges for the types of passports, prices, and duration to obtain.

If you had an old, expired passport, you have to visit the Passport Office in Niroth district. If you obtain a new passport, it's easier to go Passport sub-office in Aeon Mall Sen Sok city.

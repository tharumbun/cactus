Phnom Penh is the capital and largest city of Cambodia. It is located in the south-central part of the country, at the confluence of the Mekong, Bassac, and Tonle Sap rivers. The city has a population of over 2 million people and is a major cultural, economic, and political center in Cambodia.

Phnom Penh has a long and rich history, dating back to the 15th century. It was founded in the late 14th century by King Ponhea Yat and became the capital of the Khmer Empire in the early 15th century. The city has undergone many changes throughout its history, including periods of colonization, war, and political upheaval.

Today, Phnom Penh is known for its historical and cultural sites, including the Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda, and Wat Phnom temple. It is also home to a number of museums, art galleries, and cultural centers. The city has a vibrant nightlife scene and is known for its street food and markets. Phnom Penh is an important hub for trade and commerce in Cambodia and is home to a number of international businesses and organizations.

I've lived in Phnom Penh since the 1980s and have witnessed a tremendous transformation of the city. In the late 1980s, schooling was not about affordability; there was just no choice. Just a few years after the Khmer Rouge regime, being able to go to a public school about five minutes' walk from home was a luxury. Back then, unofficial playgrounds were everywhere, and as a kid, I could spend most of my time outdoors with other kids in my neighborhood.

Fast forward to today: public schools are publicly known for providing lower, if not poor, quality than private ones. There are many choices when going through the long list of private schools, but it's about affordability. These days, kids are very protected for safety and security reasons, and increasingly, kids spend time in their homes playing games on their iPads. In this post, I'm going to list down some of the things you should know.

The air quality in Phnom Penh can vary depending on the time of year and the specific location within the city. In general, the air quality in Phnom Penh is considered to be poor. The city experiences high levels of air pollution, particularly during the dry season, when dust and sand from nearby construction projects and agriculture can contribute to poor air quality. In addition, there is a lot of vehicle traffic in Phnom Penh, which can also contribute to air pollution.

Factors that can affect air quality in Phnom Penh include emissions from industrial activities, traffic, and open burning. The city's population and economic growth, as well as its location in a low-lying area, can exacerbate the air pollution problem.

You check the air quality index before planning outdoor activities in Phnom Penh, and to take necessary precautions such as wearing a mask if the air quality is poor.

### How polluted is Phnom Penh?

Recent research by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) shows that the largest sources of pollution in Cambodia today are transport, electricity generation, industry, and residential development.

Phnom Penh has grown rapidly in recent years in terms of economic development, among other things. However, this growth has also led to increased air pollution in the city. The burning of fuels such as petroleum, diesel, and coal in the transport, household, industrial, and energy sectors all contribute to the air pollution problem in Southeast Asian cities. In 2018, Cambodia ranked 164th out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) for air quality.

How bad is air pollution in Phnom Penh? According to Leakhena Hang and Lorn Soklis of the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC), in their "Assessment of People Perception on Air Quality in Phnom Penh, Capital City of Cambodia," published in November 2020, "Fine particulate matter PM2.5 is a big concern parameter among other air pollutants which can cause effects to human health in the short and long-term."

Should air pollution in Phnom Penh be a concern? Given the potential health risks associated with exposure to PM2.5 and other pollutants, it is important for both residents of Phnom Penh and visitors to the city to be aware of the air quality and take steps to reduce their own contributions to the problem, if possible.

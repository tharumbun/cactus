In Phnom Penh, there are so many choices when it comes to eating good food. If a dish of noodles is your favorite like mine, then let's find out some of the best restaurants in town. What you will find in my selections are: Chinese noodle styles, Cambodian noodle (Num Banh Chok), Ramen, and Udon.


 Highly recommended: the best place to eat fried noodle in Phnom Penh. Located on Charles de Gaulle Blvd (217) and corner of street Ung Pokun (109): https://goo.gl/maps/tbvU43YUwwpRYhWh9

Like a Chinese city, having noodle soup for breakfast is quite common. So every morning, it's not hard to stroll the city streets and find your breakfast noodle fix.

‚ÄòMost of us have a personal favourite ‚Äòkuy teav‚Äô spot. üçú Where in Phnom Penh is yours?

Kuy teav is what the locals in Phnom Penh call. This name is very old, so it sounds like gu«íti√°o from the Cambodia‚Äôs Teochew community. How about Chinese noodle soup made in Cambodia by Khmer? Steamy ‚Äòkuy teav‚Äô is great quick breakfast fix.

This Khmer Chinese flavorful kuy teav is what you should taste each you're in Cambodia's Phnom Penh.

According to Wikipedia, "Kuyteav is a Cambodian noodle soup consisting of rice noodles with pork stock and toppings. A popular breakfast dish in Cambodia, kuyteav can be found at marketplace stalls, roadside vendors, and restaurants." This steaming bowl of (either chicken or beef or pork) broth filled with noodles is everyday Cambodian breakfast to start a beautiful day with coffee.

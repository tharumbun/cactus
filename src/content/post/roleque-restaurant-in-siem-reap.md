Roleque is a popular restaurant in Siem Reap that serves a variety of Khmer and international dishes. The restaurant is located in the heart of the city, making it a convenient option for tourists. The interior of the restaurant is spacious and air-conditioned, making it a comfortable place to dine. The staff is friendly and attentive, and the food is delicious.

I had the opportunity to dine at Roleque twice during my recent trip to Siem Reap. On my first visit, I ordered the Khmer chicken curry, which was flavorful and well-seasoned. On my second visit, I ordered the pad thai, which was also delicious. The portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable.

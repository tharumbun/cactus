Love shopping? How to get the best out of your shopping experience when in Phnom Penh? It's this time of the year again that you want to buy some of electronics and gadgets yourself, your family members and friends. This mini guide will help you discover great gadgets as well as good shops you can buy them in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Remember that the price is negotiable, so don't be afraid to negotiate for a better deal. Keep in mind that a little bit of haggling can go a long way in getting a good deal and make a great purchase.

### Tips to keep in mind when shopping in Cambodia (especially Phnom Penh)

By keeping these tips in mind, you can enjoy a pleasant and rewarding shopping experience in Cambodia while minimizing any potential issues.

When shopping in Cambodia, there are a few things you should be aware of to ensure a positive and hassle-free experience. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

Bargaining: Bargaining is a common practice in Cambodia, especially in local markets and smaller shops. Sellers often quote higher prices initially, so don't be afraid to negotiate for a lower price. However, remember to be polite and respectful during the bargaining process.

Counterfeit goods: Be cautious when purchasing branded items at incredibly low prices, as Cambodia has a reputation for counterfeit goods. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Shop from reputable stores or authorized retailers to minimize the risk of purchasing counterfeit products.

Quality and authenticity: Always inspect the quality and authenticity of the products you intend to purchase. This is particularly important when buying gemstones, textiles, handicrafts, and traditional souvenirs. Research and educate yourself about the particular item you wish to buy so that you can make an informed decision.

Pickpocketing and theft: Like in any crowded tourist destination, be cautious about your belongings and stay vigilant to minimize the risk of pickpocketing or theft. Keep your bags and valuables close to you, preferably in front, and avoid displaying expensive items in public.

Currency exchange: Cambodia's official currency is the Cambodian Riel (KHR), but US dollars are widely accepted and often preferred by tourists. It's a good idea to carry a mix of both currencies. Be cautious when receiving change in USD, as some vendors may try to give you counterfeit bills or shortchange you.

Shop around: Before making a purchase, take some time to explore different shops and compare prices. The price of similar items can vary significantly from one shop to another, so it's worth checking multiple places to ensure you get the best deal.

VAT refunds: If you plan to make significant purchases, inquire about the possibility of obtaining a Value Added Tax (VAT) refund. Certain stores participate in the VAT refund scheme for tourists, allowing you to claim a portion of the taxes paid on eligible goods upon departure.

Cultural sensitivity: Cambodia has a rich cultural heritage, so it's essential to be respectful of local customs and traditions while shopping. Dress modestly, especially when visiting temples or religious sites. Avoid haggling aggressively or behaving disrespectfully towards vendors, as it can be seen as offensive.

One of Phnom Penh's largest and oldest market, this is where middle class and higher rich local Cambodians love to come shopping. While this is one of the most popular markets in the city among tourists, the Central Market is also known for having fresh seafood. The best time to buy seafood like crabs, squids, or lobsters is in the afternoon. The price goes down a bit later in the day. You should avoid Orrusey market if you want good or fresh enough seafood. Good here also means good price in addition to quality. We compared price with local popular seafood restaurant like Sonivid, and found that this market is better than others for seafood.

**Russian Market**

or known as Tuol Tumpoung among locals is popular for visitors and tourists to shop gifts to bring back home. International brand clothes and shoes are available on sale at a reasonable price. Most of the American and Western brands are produced at factories in Cambodia, so that's one of the reasons you can buy jeans and t-shirts way cheaper than stores in New York city.

It's the first largest shopping mall in the heart of Phnom Penh along the Sisowath Quay. Just a few walks from the Diamond Island, Aeon Mall sets the direction and trend for Phnom Penh shoppers.

**Makro Phnom Penh: Thai Market in Cambodia**

is also the first wholesale supermarket that is hard to avoid for those looking for imported products from neighboring country Thailand. Read more about Makro market here.

The first Japanese AEON mega mall has been a huge success in the heart of Phnom Penh. In 2018, Makro Cambodia in Sen Sok district is the first Thai-based Siam Makro to offer Cambodian shoppers and Phnom Penhers unbeatable prices for most (not all) Thailand-made products.

About ten years back, Cambodian middle class people had to travel to Thailand's Bangkok to buy good quality products. Despite shopping in the heart of Bangkok is a leisure for some Khmer richie elites, the exported products to Cambodia and available at Market market in Cambodia is very much welcoming.

In this review, you'll learn some of the best products, including home improvements, electronics, food and beverages available in the Makro market in Sen Sok branch. If you don't like to bargain in local markets in Phnom Penh, then head to the Makro market.

**Thai food & beverages**

If you prefer Thai products from Thailand, this Makro market is probably your first choice. Actually, there are more than just Thai made products available on the tall, large shelves in this shopping mall. However, a lot of the items are imported from Thailand. Khmer people love the Thai Mama noodles. This is the best place to buy this favorite brand noodles. The bakery section is also a nice corner to get bread. Thai snacks are typically sold in bulk packages at a cheaper price are at the back of the market hall.

Once a quiet district of Phnom Penh city, TK Avenue is an addition of shopping spree area for the residents in Tuol Kork. Unlike the Aeon mega mall in Chamkarmon district, TK Avenue is quite unique in its offerings and space: an open-air mall that hosts a good number of high-end luxury shops and restaurants. Metro Restaurant is just on the corner as you enter the TK Avenue.

### How to bargain when in Cambodia

Bargaining is a common practice in Cambodia, particularly when shopping at markets and street vendors. Here are a few tips for bargaining effectively in Cambodia:

1. Start low: When bargaining, it's best to start with a lower offer than what you're willing to pay. This allows room for negotiation and gives the seller an idea of your budget.
2. Be friendly and polite: Bargaining can be a fun and friendly activity, and being respectful and polite can go a long way in getting a good deal.
3. Be willing to walk away: If you're not getting the price you want, be willing to walk away. This shows the seller that you're serious about your offer and that you're not afraid to leave.
4. Compare prices: Before making an offer, it's a good idea to compare prices at different vendors to get an idea of what is a fair price.
5. Do not be afraid to haggle: Bargaining is a cultural norm in Cambodia, and vendors expect you to haggle. Don't be afraid to negotiate a lower price, as it's expected.
6. Be aware of the local currency: Make sure you have a rough idea of the exchange rate and the local currency so you can make an informed offer and not get ripped off.
7. Be aware of the cultural context: Be aware of the cultural context, it's not considered rude to bargain in Cambodia and it's a way to show interest in the product and respect for the seller.

### A mini guide to shopping electronics and gadgets in Phnom Penh

Sometimes on a fine day the best thing to do is curl up with a good book â or every book, as the Kindle lets you do, without the distractions of a tablet. If you have your heart set on the latest Kindle Paperwhite, head over to Sweet Memory Store. Since 2012, the store has been the first choice for those who want to buy the best-selling e-book reader.

In addition to Kindle e-readers, you can find some other niche, good gadget products like [Chromecast](https://sweetmemorystore.com/product/google-chromecast/), Google's most popular streaming device, as well as Raspberry Pi starter kit. You can ask for wrapped gifts (free).

[Best Books About Cambodia](https://cambopedia.com/best-books-about-cambodia/)

Living in a city like Phnom Penh, you can now have a lot of choices. You can easily buy new print books, although some time it's hard to get the ones you want. Monument Book Store is probably the largest place you can go and find a copy of your wanted books. However, some newest titles may take longer to be available in the book stores.

An ideal way to get to read is getting an e-reader like a Kindle. Below you'll find 10 reasons why you need a Kindle, especially when you live and work in a Southeast Asian country like Cambodia. This blog post will also point out where to buy the Kindle in Phnom Penh.

Currently there are 4 models of Kindle e-readers. The Kindle, the Kindle Paperwhite, the Kindle Voyage, the Kindle Oasis. The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive with the same resolution to the Kindle Voyage and the Paperwhite.

It is time we all admit it: if you are a book reader then the Kindle is a lot better for you than an iPad. Did you know that there are no apps on a Kindle? No App Store. No Play Store. No App World. No Marketplace. Just things to read.

It weighs less than a physical book. You can hold it for an hour or more and read without having muscle cramps. The iPad wonât give you that. The iPad is humongous. At 10â it requires a bag. You can take your Kindle everywhere, and at times you put it in your pocket.

Do you get sore eyes reading on your iPad? That wonât happen with the Kindle â thereâs no back lighting on it, so it feels just like reading a real book. With the Kindle it is second nature. That e-ink technology that is about to pass from this world just works better for a reading experience.

**Buying a smartphone in Phnom Penh**

Every year, I cover this favorite topic, the best shops to buy the best smartphone in Phnom Penh. A new major update to last year review is that you can easily buy a Motorola phone. From Moto C to Moto G, these budget smartphones with Motorola brand are available in most phone shops in the Cambodian capital city.

Believe it or not, you can buy any smartphone in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. There are thousand shops across this Southeast Asian city. From Apple to Samsung to Huawei, you have a lot of choices. This year, Motorola made a comeback to Cambodia after a long absence from the market. Apple iPhone is probably the most popular smartphone among Cambodian users.

Android smartphone fans

After Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and soon Motorolla are dominating the smartphone market in Cambodia.

The best smartphone: Apple iPhone vs. Google Pixel vs. Xiaomi smartphone In Phnom Penh, you have a lot of choices when it comes to buying an Apple products, either a MacBook, or an iPad, or an iPhone.

The iPhone became available as soon as Apple announced. Early customers can have their hands on the iPhone as long as they're willing to pay the high price tag. Check out these three smart phone shops for iPhone prices and order: Sokly Phone Shop, HAKSE, Apsara Electronics.

Not an Apple iPhone fan? Then go for Android. Google made its own brand-name smartphone, which is called Pixel. It's been received positive reviews since its official launch in October this year. One of the downside of buying this Google's flagship smartphone in Cambodia's Phnom Penh is the price.

It's probably due to the fact that Apple products are more popular than Google gadgets. Google Pixel is available at Koungy phone shop. At the time of writing this, the Xiaomi's latest smartphone Mi MIX isn't available in stock at any shop yet. We'll update this as soon as we get it.

**Buy a New TV in Phnom Penh?**

Are you shopping for a brand new TV in Phnom Penh? Here's list of the shops you can buy TV with the best price.

Kfour Group, one of Phnom Penh's largest stores selling electronics and home appliances, is currently offering best deals for many many products, from air conditioners to smart televisions. The best deal for products like TV is to celebrate its anniversary.

We have just bought an LG TV 43" FULL HD TV. The original price is $599. After discounted, the smart IPS screen TV is only $409. This is the model number: 43LH570T.

Why LG 43LH570T over Sony Bravia? Before we decided to go for LG over long-time favorite Sony, we took a look at a several key features. Sony 40" LED Full HD TV (KLV-40R352D) is only now $345 (before $399). So the Sony TV is 40", not 43". Small difference. But the big difference is the the LG's IPS (In-plane switching), an improved screen technology for color. This IPS technology is being used by Apple for its latest iPhone, iPad and MacBook with Retina Display. IPS panels have the best color reproduction of any standard LCD display.

Surprisingly, LCD panels that offer IPS, however, generally have a viewing angle of 170 degrees. As a result, you can watch your TV from a greater angle and the picture will look about the same. The IPS was early developed by Hitachi Ltd. in 1996, and later sold to Panasonic. Later, LG Display and other South Korean, Japanese, and Taiwanese LCD manufacturers adapted IPS technology.

For those who find it difficult to shop for a TV in Phnom Penh, it's quite convenient to head to the Makro market. This year, as I shopped for a new flat screen, full HD TV, I went to KFour, a shop house near the Central Market, and in this Makro market.

Popular brands such as Sony, LG, Samsung, and Toshiba are on display near the entry as you step in the huge market hall. Prices are quite comparable to those shops around Phsar Thmey. Thai quality electronics products like fans or rice cookers are some of the items you can buy at a good price.

**Where else to buy LG products?** G Gear sells all the LG brand name products, from TV to mobile phones to home appliances.

AEON Mall 1 and 2 have showrooms where you can get the real world demonstration plus latest price (with good deal and promotion during holiday seasons).

**Buying Apple Products in Phnom Penh**

Although there is no official Apple Store like Bangkok, living in Phnom Penh doesn't limit you from buying a new iPhone as soon as it's officially available. If you're willing to pay a premium price, you can be among the early persons to get your hands on Apple's newest iPhone.

Apple iPhone

iPhone is much loved here in Cambodia. Cambodian people love iPhone more than anything else. Although the price isn't so affordable, the local people save as much as they can to buy a used iPhone, if not a new one.

This popularity of iPhone use in Cambodia means that the Apple brand is also widespread across the country.

In Phnom Penh, phone shops (not really official Apple stores) have the latest or even previous models of the iPhone available in stock for grab.

If you compare the iPhone price in Phnom Penh with other cities in Southeast Asia, you can always get a better price. In addition to this, anyone in Phnom Penh with deep pocket can always buy the newest iPhone model as soon as it's available in the US market.

This has already happened with the previous models like iPhone 6 and iPhone 7. So if you're planning to spend money on buying an iPhone 8 or iPhone X, you will surely be able to get one as soon as it's released.

**Buying an Apple MacBook Pro in Phnom Penh**

Recently I've bought a brand new Apple MacBook Retina. Before buying the computer laptop, I spent some hours researching into computer shops or stores in Phnom Penh. There are many shops retailing Apple MacBook laptops and gadgets. But the question is which shop is the most trusted to get genuine products. By genuine, I mean a new MacBook computer, not a refurbished machine. Getting a refurbished laptop at a new price is not just expensive, but would be a terrible experience.

You can buy the MacBook Pro Retina at Uniyoung, an Apple's authorized retailer near the Central Market (Phsa Thmey).

According to Apple's official web sites, I can find that some shops are recognized as Apple certified store. So it's no longer the case to buy a MacBook laptop, an iPhone, or an iPad when you're in the USA, or Singapore, or Bangkok. You can easily get one here. The trick is knowing the good shop to buy.

After comparing prices and learning about support and services by a number of shops (see the list below), I decided to go to UNI YOUNG TECHNOLOGIES.

UNI YOUNG has a good reputation for some years for having qualified technical support for both hardware and software. I actually found Khmer Plus Computer's offer cheaper price for MacBook Retina. But this shop isn't listed on Apple site as an official retailer.

This is 2016 and there is no Apple Store in Cambodia's Phnom Penh city just yet. No news and rumor just yet.

However, here's a list of Apple's authorized retailers (based on Apple.com). Some stores sell only computers, not smartphones (iPhone) and tablets (iPad).

For those who can wait, you'll be able to get an iPhone 7 at Apple's authorized retailers such as iOne and Smart (a Cambodian mobile operator). However, three phone shops, Sok Ly, Hak Se and Apsara Electronics in Phnom Penh, are popular for those who want the newest iPhone as soon the water-resistant smartphone is available on the market (wherever it is).

These two Phnom Penh-based phone shops, as in previous years, accepts pre-orders from Khmer riches or Cambodian elites who fancy to be the early iPhone 7 users.

Check out these three smart phone shops for iPhone prices before you decide to buy. Sokly Phone Shop HAKSE one-stop center for mobile phone and accessory in Cambodia Apsara Electronics

Cambodia's leading mobile operator is probably one of the best places to buy a new iPhone.

**How to buy products online from China and USA from Cambodia**

The world is flat. This is a guide to buying products from Amazon.com, Ebay, Aliexpress and other online shops and ship them to Cambodia. These days, you can buy many products from abroad and have them delivered to you.

Initially, you may think that all those major online shopping sites don't ship their stuff to Cambodia. This is a wrong assumption. Secondly, you may think that Cambodia's Post Office is terrible. This is no longer true. The Internet and the so-called e-commerce have opened the endless the possibility for businesses in countries like the United States of America, China (+ Hong Kong), Singapore, South Korea, or some European countries to sell their electronics products, books, clothes, and everything between to a developing country like Cambodia.

This guide is based on my experience of buying products (big and small size) and have them shipped to Phnom Penh from various online shopping stores like Amazon.com, Ebay, Aliexpress and more since 2012.

**Buying products from Amazon.com and getting them delivered to you in Cambodia**

Amazon is earth's largest product store you can buy almost anything. Although most of the products could be shipped from the USA, not every product on Amazon.com could be shipped to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, just yet.

With AmazonGlobal program, international shipping for order from Amazon is possible and easy. There is also a requirement for Import Deposit Fee, which helps you not worry about dealing with the DHL deliveryman for any custom issue

[According to Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201117970), "for AmazonGlobal items, you won't be charged additional fees if the actual Import Fees exceed the Import Fees Deposit we estimated."

eBay also offers a similar program for international sellers to make it easier for a buyer like you.

**How to buy products from online stores and ship them to Phnom Penh**

- A recipient address in Phnom Penh. Having a home address in Phnom Penh makes it easier. You also need to give your telephone number, so that the Phnom Penh Post Office can easily contact you when your package or parcel reach its destination.
- A Visa card (better connect it to Paypal for a more secure payment). As you have to pay for the products you buy, you need a valid Visa card. You can obtain one from one of the banks in Phnom Penh. Cathay United Bank offers a debit card (Visa) you can quickly use. It's also easy to use it with a Paypal account.
- A shopping list. You want to buy a book or a gadget?

**Buying quality medicines imported from Thailand?**

There is a pharmacy within the Makro market where you can buy a variety of medicines with some help from the professional staff. This first Thai Makro market in Sen Sok district is the first branch in Phnom Penh. It's not in the central city. If you take a Tuk Tuk, a taxi (PassApp or Grab), it's about half an hour from the riverside or Boeung Keng Kang area. For those who live in Tuol Kork area, the Makro market is just about 10 minutes drive, which is quite convenient. The Makro market is just a few walk from the second AEON mall.

This is probably a new shopping center in this Sen Son, once a quiet district of this Cambodian capital city. For those keep asking where's the best place to buy Thai products? Makro market. Thailand has to export more of its domestic products to Asean market. This Makro market is strategically one way to expand its reach. The second AEON mall is just a few walks from the Makro, making buying spree easier just like in Bangkok.

**Aeon Mall: Phnom Penh's Most Popular Shopping Center**

There are currently two Aeon malls in Phnom Penh. The first mall opened its door a throng of Phnom Penh residents in 2016. The second mall (opened in 2018), larger than the first one, is located on the outskirt of the city in Sen Sok District. With the growing number of shopping malls, Phnom Penh is becoming a mini Bangkok.

**The first mall: AEON MALL Phnom Penh (on Samdach Sothearos Boulevard)** **The second mall: AEON MALL Sen Sok City**

**The third mall: AEON MALL (inside ING CITY, Phnom Penh, Kingdom of Cambodia)**

**12 Reasons Why Aeon Malls So Popular in Phnom Penh City?**

1\. The largest malls in the heart of Phnom Penh

With the Japanese investors behind the $200 million Aeon, it's now Cambodia's largest shopping mall in the heart of Phnom Penh. It's the probably world class mall the city has.

You can find Major Cineplex, the biggest cinema complex that's equipped with VIP screen and 4DX cinema. Coffee shops like Brown Coffee and Starbucks have to serve their customers in these crowded malls.

Big parking lots.

2\. Big Brands

It's the first mall where you can only find genuine brand-name products. Of course, there is a US$2 store that has all things Chinese made products in a shop called Daiso. Most top international brands are on show in the malls.

3\. The Taste of Capitalism

It's where Cambodians can experience and feel the taste of _capitalism_.

4\. Escape from the Heat of Phnom Penh

You can escape from the heat and dust of Phnom Penh by roaming or sitting in a fully air conditioned mall. So Aeon is more or less one of the most comfortable places for window shoppers.

5\. Learn How to Queue

Khmer people from across Cambodia can start learning how to wait in line to test the most convenient rest rooms, designed for women, men, and even toddlers. This is probably like when the Sorya Mall was first opened to Cambodian customers. The lift and elevator were the most attractive things people want to touch.

6\. Spacious and High Class

Most visitors are impressed by the decorations and design. High class.

7\. A Record of 100,000 Visitors a Day

With an average of 100,000 visitors a day since it opened, it outnumbers the total number of visitors at both Sorya and Sovanna shopping malls combined. Sorya and Sovanna malls are considered luxurious malls by Cambodian standard, too.

8\. No Bargain

Shoppers don't need to use their bargaining skill at all. What you see is the last price. While bargaining is common among shoppers in a city like Phnom Penh, the rule in Aeon is simple. Price tag is there. How do you bother to bargain. The rental fee in the mall isn't cheap. The stall owners have to share their profit with the mall operator.

9\. Full Parking Lots

Despite the four-story mall sits on 100,000 sq m off can house 1,400 cars and 1,600 motorbikes, it doesn't always welcome visitors in luxury vehicles. You can find the sign of 'No Parking & Come back later' space surrounding the mall area.

10\. The Malls for Young Phnom Penh Residents

As the mega-mall targets the 20 to 30-year-olds, it targets Cambodia's largest populations.

**Phnom Penh's Exchange Square**

These are stunning views from the 19th floor of the Exchange Square, one of Phnom Penh's tallest buildings and shopping malls in one. It's amazing to see some of Phnom Penh's iconic places like the Central Market (Phsar Thmey) and the riverside from this new angle.

The Exchange Square opened in 2017 to the public. The building houses premium offices and retail shops. These photos were taken from the Huawei office.

Inside the Exchange Square Phnom Penh residents would go to the large Lucky Supermarket, or go to the movie theater (The Legend Cinema) with large and comfortable seats (a Phnom Penh's high-class theater). On the ground floor, there is also the Hard Rock Cafe and a Starbucks coffee shop. There are also some good wine shops and well stocked grocery shops. Yet, the AEON Malls are much bigger in size and have more shops.

Close to Wat Phnom, this new commercial building, shopping mall, and office tower is clean and quiet with a lot of parking spaces underground. A nice place for coffee meeting and shopping, the Exchange Square is a bold, taller edition of the AEON mega mall.

The Exchange Square is an interesting take for Cambodia as its slogan is "Where Cambodia Meets Hong Kong." Really? You decide.

The new year is here and with it comes the much-awaited European Film Festival Cambodia (EUFF23). Hosted by the European Union Delegation to Cambodia, this film festival promises to be a delight for film lovers of all ages. With an eclectic collection of films from over 20 countries, this year’s festival will feature 26 feature films, two short film events and a host of unique activities.

### Key Attractions

This year’s festival will take place at four different locations across Phnom Penh - Bophana Center, French Institute, Meta House, and Aeon 1 Mall’s Major Cineplex theatre. It brings European cinema and insights from industry professionals to the public, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the film industry.

### Pre-event Panel Discussion

Kicking off the festival will be a pre-event panel discussion on February 14th at Phnom Penh’s French Institute. The panel, which will be attended by Kosamak San, Ines Sothea, Cedric Eloy, Jimmy Henderson, and Nicolas Sacré, will examine cross-cultural collaboration and its impact on Cambodia’s next generation of movie makers. Nicolas Sacré, Dean of Phnom Penh’s PSE film school, will provide insights on the transcendent power of cinema and its ability to open our eyes and minds to the world.

### Opening Night

Ukrainian film, Mother of Apostles, will be the first film to be screened at the festival. Directed by Zaza Buadze, this award-winning feature film is based on a true story and focuses on the transformative power of love in the face of brutality. The screening will take place on February 17th at the French Institute’s garden, and will feature drinks and canapés for guests.

The European Film Festival Cambodia (EUFF23) promises to be a ten-day celebration of cinema and culture.

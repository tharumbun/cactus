If you're coming to Phnom Penh for the first time and wondering about how to spend your time wisely, this post is all about things you can do in this capital city of Cambodia. But remember that I'm a local resident. So it's pretty much from my perspectives and experience as a Phnom Penher. Founded in 1372, Cambodia's largest city is known for its historical architecture and attractions. Also known as the Pearl of Asia or Paris of the East, I think it really matters when it comes to how many days you've got when visiting Phnom Penh. But, you can decide things you want to do based on your preference. I'll try to answer some of the most frequently asked questions like: free things to do or unusual to do in Phnom Penh. Before we get started, let's see if these posts I wrote may be of help for you: [Phnom Penh nightlife](https://cambopedia.com/phnom-penh-nightlife/)

### What to do when in Phnom Penh?

**Relaxation**

Stressing out? You should take care of body and mind. How about floating effortlessly on a bed of water that has been saturated with over a thousand pounds of Epsom salt? You can have a regular float practice at Floating Phnom Penh. According its founder, "floating is about sensory deprivation, getting away from all the external 'noise' and having a very peaceful environment which can be very relaxing and reinvigorating." He added that "it's the first one in the Cambodian city of Phnom Penh."

**Shopping**

### Five things to consider doing when visiting Phnom Penh

Phnom Penh, the capital and largest city of Cambodia, offers a wide variety of things to see and do for visitors. From historical sites to vibrant markets, the city has something for everyone. Here are five things to consider doing when visiting Phnom Penh:

**Visit the Royal Palace**

The Royal Palace is one of the most important historical sites in the city and is home to the Cambodian king. The palace is a beautiful complex of buildings and temples that are a must-see for anyone interested in Cambodian culture and history.

**See the Killing Fields and Tuol Sleng Museum**

These sites are sobering reminders of the atrocities committed during the Khmer Rouge regime and they offer a powerful insight into the recent history of Cambodia.

**Wander around the Central Market**

The Central Market, also known as Phsar Thmei, is a vibrant and bustling market that offers a wide variety of goods, from clothes and souvenirs to food and spices. It's a great place to experience the local culture and buy some traditional Cambodian handicrafts.

**Take a boat ride on the Mekong River**

The Mekong River is one of the most iconic features of Cambodia, and taking a boat ride on it is a great way to see the city from a different perspective and to experience the local culture.

**Take a cooking class**

Cambodian cuisine is delicious and diverse, taking a cooking class is a great way to learn how to make traditional Cambodian dishes, it's also a great opportunity to learn more about the culture and the history of the country through its food.

These are just a few of the many things to do and see when visiting Phnom Penh. The city also has many other places of interest like Wat Phnom, Silver Pagoda, Independence Monument, etc, that can be added to the list. And it's always a good idea to ask locals for recommendations, as they know the city best and can help you find hidden gems and lesser-known places to explore.

In Phnom Penh, the charming capital city, Cheoung Ek and the S-21 prison (for those who are brave enough to delve into the country's dark past).Â S-21 prison is an ideal place to visit and learn about Khmer history.

You might want to visit the floating villages on the Tonle Sap lake. Cambodians people are typically friendly, smiley, and polite. If you're planning a long-term stay in Cambodia, you'd be able to figure out how to enjoy the low cost of living.

**Phnom Penh Safari Zoo**

This Phnom Penh's first zoo is located in Prek Tasek commune, Chroy Changvar district, about 18 kilometers from Phnom Penh.

### A day trip to the Silk Island from Phnom Penh

The Silk Island (or Koh Sach known among locals) has been a popular day trip for bikers and Phnom Penh visitors who want to take a break from the crowded capital city. If you want to spend a relaxing time away from Phnom Penh, you should pay a visit to this Silk Island, a local pinic place on the entire, big Koh Oknha Tei.

**Koh Oknha Tei**

While the Silk Island is more known to tourists, the name of the entire island is Koh Oknha Tei. Oknah is a honorific title given by His Majesty the King of Cambodia. Thus, the entire island is named after Oknha Tei, who a long time ago contributed greatly to this commune. So, on this Oknha Tei island, there are several more places called islands. It's as if there are smaller islands (at least by name) on this Koh Oknha Tei.

**Silk Island or Koh Dach**

Known for being a village that makes Krama and Khmer silks (or silk weaving village), tourists get there to visit the homes of villagers who still work on this by hands. In addition to this, there are places to hang out for a drink or lunch. Unlike in Kien Svay, another local picnic site, the Khmer villagers on this Silk Island don't market much their local produces like vegetables and fruits. As you get on and drive into the middle part of the island, you can see the green fields where corns, papayas, and mangoes.

**How to Get to the Silk Island**

It's easy to get there. The distance from Wat Phnom to the Silk Island is about 10 km or about an hour drive. You can hire a Tuk Tuk for a day long trip or just get a PassApp driver. To across the Mekong river, there are ferries getting back and forth. Usually, it doesn't take long to wait to catch the ferry, which cost about a dollar for a round ferry cross. When you get to the other side, you would realize that it's a rural Cambodian village still in development. It might not be long that this small, beautiful island will be transformed into a village of village and boutique hotels.

There is a small resort on the Silk Island that is called Koh Sneh. You can also order meals and sit by the riverside.

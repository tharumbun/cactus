When in Cambodia, if browsing the Internet is not safe and fast, you may consider using some of the tips here. Here are some tips to help you browse the internet faster:

**Get faster Internet with better DNS**

You should use either Cloudflare DNS or Google DNS. Cloudflare provides the 1.1.1.1 DNS (Domain Name System) service. Its warp is an additional feature which augments our mobile apps but will always remain optional. Browsing a faster, more private Internet? Check out this instruction: [https://1.1.1.1/dns/](https://1.1.1.1/dns/)

_Why you should use an alternative DNS, instead of the default one from your Internet provider?_

The DNS can improve browsing the Internet by translating domain names into IP addresses, which allows web browsers to locate and connect to websites more quickly and efficiently. By using a reliable and fast DNS service, users can experience faster website loading times, improved security, and fewer connection errors. Additionally, DNS can be used to block access to malicious or unwanted websites, and to bypass regional restrictions or censorship.

**Clear your browser's cache and cookies**

Clearing your browser's cache and cookies can help speed up your browsing by removing stored data that can slow down your browser.

**Use an ad blocker**

Ads can significantly slow down your browsing experience. Installing an ad blocker can help speed up your browsing by blocking ads and other unwanted content.

**Disable unnecessary browser extensions**

Browser extensions can slow down your browsing speed. Disable any extensions you're not using to help speed up your browsing experience.

**Use a faster DNS server**

DNS servers translate website addresses into IP addresses. Using a faster DNS server can help speed up your browsing by reducing the time it takes for your browser to find the IP address of a website.

**Upgrade your internet plan**

If you're experiencing slow browsing speeds, it may be because of your internet plan. Upgrading to a faster internet plan can help improve your browsing speed.

**Use a wired connection**

A wired connection is usually faster than a wireless connection, so try connecting your device directly to your modem or router with an Ethernet cable.

**Use a modern browser**

Some older browsers are slower and less efficient than newer ones. Using a modern browser, like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, can help improve your browsing speed.

Keep in mind that other factors, like the website you're visiting, the time of day, and the number of people using your internet connection, can also affect your browsing speed.

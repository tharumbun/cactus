Planning a trip to Cambodia is an exciting prospect for any traveler. With its rich cultural heritage, breathtaking landscapes, and warm hospitality, Cambodia offers an unforgettable experience. However, like any international journey, it's essential to be prepared with the right travel essentials. One crucial item you'll need is a travel adapter to keep your electronic devices charged and ready to capture those memorable moments. In this blog post, we'll delve into the world of travel adapters for Cambodia, ensuring you have a hassle-free and enjoyable adventure in this enchanting country.

### Your Ultimate Guide to Travel Adapters for Cambodia

Understanding Cambodia's Power Outlets:

Before diving into the specifics of travel adapters, let's familiarize ourselves with Cambodia's power outlets. The standard voltage is 230V, and the frequency is 50Hz. Cambodia primarily uses Type A and Type C plugs.

Type A: This plug has two flat parallel pins. It's similar to the plugs used in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and other countries.
Type C: This plug has two round pins and is commonly used in European countries.
Types of Travel Adapters:
Now that we know the power outlet types in Cambodia, let's explore the different travel adapters available:

Type A to Type A Adapter: If your home country's power plugs are of Type A, you won't need a physical adapter, as they match Cambodia's outlets. However, it's always a good idea to carry a universal travel adapter that can be used in other destinations as well.

Type C to Type A Adapter: This adapter allows you to plug in your Type C devices into Type A outlets. Many European travelers might find this adapter useful, as they often use Type C plugs in their home countries.

Universal Travel Adapter: If you're traveling from a country with different plug types, investing in a universal travel adapter is a wise decision. These adapters usually support multiple plug configurations and are compatible with various power outlets around the world.

USB Travel Adapter: A USB travel adapter can be a lifesaver, especially if you have multiple devices to charge simultaneously. It has USB ports that allow you to connect your devices' charging cables directly without the need for a separate plug adapter.

Where to Buy Travel Adapters:
You can find travel adapters at various locations:

Online Retailers: Websites like Amazon, eBay, or specialty travel stores offer a wide range of travel adapters that you can purchase before your trip.

Airport Shops: Many international airports have shops that sell travel essentials, including travel adapters.

Local Stores in Cambodia: If you happen to forget your adapter, you can buy one at local stores in Cambodia, particularly in popular tourist areas or shopping centers.

Tips for Using Travel Adapters:
Here are some essential tips to ensure you have a smooth experience with your travel adapter in Cambodia:

Check Voltage Compatibility: Before plugging in your devices, verify if they can handle the 230V voltage in Cambodia. Most modern devices, like smartphones and laptops, are designed to work with a wide voltage range, but it's always best to double-check.

Use Surge Protectors: To protect your electronic devices from voltage fluctuations or power surges, consider using a surge protector in conjunction with your travel adapter.

Carry Extra Adapters: It's a good idea to carry a spare travel adapter or a multi-plug power strip, especially if you have several devices to charge.

Research Your Accommodation: Some hotels in Cambodia might provide universal plug outlets or have adapters available for guests. Check with your accommodation beforehand to avoid carrying unnecessary adapters.


The standard voltage in Cambodia is 230 V and the frequency is 50 Hz. So if you are traveling from a country with a different voltage, you will need a travel adaptor.

Here are a few things to keep in mind when choosing a travel adaptor for Cambodia:

* Make sure the adaptor is compatible with the sockets in Cambodia. The sockets in Cambodia are Type A and Type C.
* Choose an adaptor that has a voltage converter. This will ensure that your devices are not damaged by the higher voltage in Cambodia.
* Make sure the adaptor is sturdy and well-made. You don't want it to break while you're traveling.

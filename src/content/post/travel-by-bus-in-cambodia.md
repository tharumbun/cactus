### From Phnom Penh to Siem Reap by Bus

Traveling by bus is a popular and affordable way to get from Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia, to Siem Reap, a city known for its proximity to the ancient temples of Angkor Wat.

**Here is an overview of how you can travel by bus from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap:**

1. Find a bus company that operates the route from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap. Some of the popular bus companies are Giant Ibis, Mekong Express, and Phnom Penh Sorya Transport.
2. Purchase a bus ticket: You can purchase bus tickets from various travel agents or at the bus station in Phnom Penh. It's always good to book in advance, especially if you're traveling during peak season. You can compare prices from different companies and decide which bus service and schedule best suits your needs.
3. Check departure location and time: Double-check the departure location and time for your bus. Most buses depart from the Phnom Penh bus station, but it's always good to confirm this with the company you are traveling with.
4. Board the bus: Arrive at the departure location at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time. Your bus ticket will have the departure time, bus number, and a seat number on it. You will need to present your ticket to the bus driver or a conductor before boarding.
5. Enjoy the journey: Bus ride will take around 6-7 hour journey, Some buses have onboard restrooms and air conditioning, while others do not. Some buses also make stops along the way to pick up or drop off passengers. It's always a good idea to bring snacks and water with you, as well as any entertainment you may want to pass the time.
6. Arrival in Siem Reap: Your bus will arrive at the Siem Reap bus station. From there, you can either take a tuk-tuk or a taxi to your hotel or guesthouse.

It is recommended to always check the most recent information about Bus service, schedules, and prices with the company, or do research on different review and travel website before booking, as there may be changes.

As of 2021, There is also direct flight from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap available which will only take you around 45 minutes of flight, but it may not be as budget-friendly as bus.

Getting to Siem Reap from Phnom Penh by bus is easier than ever. In the early 1990s, it took all day to get to Siem Reap from Phnom Penh by a mini van. The road back then was terrible.

Today, you can easily take a bus to visit the Cambodian ancient city worldly known Angkor Wat. With the new road in much better condition, the Phnom Penh to Siem Reap bus trip (with free WiFi) takes only 6 hours.

Bus & Van Schedules : from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap

- Duration and distance: 5 h 17 min (319.8 km) via National Road 6
- With BookMeBus, you can quickly check the bus schedule for Phnom Penh to Siem Reap.

In Phnom Penh, there are many bus operators include Phnom Penh Sorya Transport, Capitol Tours, Giant Ibis and GST Express. Although it is advisable to check out as many as you can before booking, we highly recommend Mekong Express (USD 10 - 13) for its better safety record. Before the arrival of luxury Giant Ibis bus operator, most foreigners and expats in Cambodia prefer Mekong Express bus operator.

Today, the Mekong Express still remains one of the best bus companies in the Kingdom of Cambodia. You get what you pay: you ticket with numbered seat for yourself. It's also very convenient as the Mekong Express bus will take you directly to your destination city rather than making random stops in between to pick up additional passengers or packages.

When it comes to your safety on the roads over here in a country like Cambodia, the Mekong Express company is OK. It's advisable that you always try and travel during the day rather than at night if you have the option as the roads and other drivers can be risky. The downside: Comparing to Giant Ibis, the Mekong Express buses are quite older (but still comfortable).

The second top rated is the [Seila Angkor Express](https://bookmebus.com/?utm_source=mtc&r=Ug5qdc84L5ododEnUfucq1MC). Its Toyota mini van offers passengers comfortable seats for between $9-$12.

The Phnom Penh to Siem Reap bus ticket can be easily purchased online through BookMeBus, a favorite bus ticket platform among expats and foreign travelers.

It's easy to make payment through BookMeBus as the online bus ticket service accepts Visa, Paypal, and a number of Cambodian methods of payment: Wing, TrueMoney, SmartLuy, or Pay&Go.

It's always a good idea to try to book the bus ticket at least the day before travel.

- Passengers should be at the terminal 15 minutes before departure.
- Passengers MUST present printed Online Tickets for inspection at the terminal prior to boarding.
- Smoking inside the bus is prohibited.

In addition to Mekong Express, you can also consider Cambodia Post VIP Van. So, taking a mini van can be also an ideal choice with about the same price.

### How to Get from Phnom Penh to Bangkok by Bus

Travelers can take a flight or bus to Siem Reap from Thailand's Bangkok. The cheapest way to enter Cambodia from Thailand is by bus. I took a Virak Buntham mini van (departure point at Pratunam Market of Phaya Thai) from Bangkok to the border before getting on a night bus to Phnom Penh. The one way ticket price for Bangkok to Phnom Penh with a stop over at the border is $21. It took the mini van about four hours from Bangkok to the Thai-Cambodian border.

After crossing the border (to go through the passport check point), I continued to Phnom Penh through its night time bus, which about six hours. The van is clean, comfortable, and air conditioned. Half way through the four-hour drive, there is a change of driver.

### How To Get from Bangkok to Siem Reap or Phnom Penh by Bus

**Crossing the border through Poipet**

It's also a good idea to get the Cambodian visa online rather than at the border crossing. However, if you're taking a direct bus from Siem Reap to Bangkok and vice versa, [Nattakan Transportation](https://bookmebus.com/en/nattakan?utm_source=mtc&r=Ug5qdc84L5ododEnUfucq1MC)'s buses are one of the two choices you've got.

From Bangkok to Siem Reap, Nattakan bus usually departs Morchit Bus Station at 8.00 AM and reaches Poipet border (Thailand-Cambodia) at around 12:30 AM. Visa on arrival takes you about 10 minutes. By 4:30 pm on the same day, you'd arrive Siem Reap. On the bus, the bus attendant provides you breakfast, coffee, juice, and lunch. Nattakan bus drops off the passengers on Sivatha Road, Krong Siem Reap, the central of the city.

Nattakan Cambodia started in 2012. On December 14, 2012, the cross-border bus company entered an agreement with Thai National Scheduled Bus Company to upgrade bus services between Cambodia and Thailand. This has made it really easier for travelers to take direct between Siem Reap and Bangkok.

Mekong Express is also one of the favorite buses among expatriates.

**Crossing the border through O Smach**

Another border crossing point is through O Smach, a small Cambodian town on the Thai border in Samraong District of Oddar Meanchey Province.

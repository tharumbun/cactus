### Wat Bo the temple

Wat Bo or Wat Reach Bo is a famous monument and archeological site in Siem Reap, built between 1650. From the roofs of temples, foundations, doors, windows, Buddha statues, thrones, pillars, paintings, paintings are all the most interesting for tourists, national and international researchers.

The magnificence of the elaborate design of the sculptural structures was damaged and lost its original beauty in some places due to the weather, age, reproduction, cracks, dust and smoke, incense, candles and so on. That is why the Apsara Authority has collaborated with Italian experts to renovate this temple in order to preserve and revitalize the culture of ancient Khmer art today.

Why Cambopedia?

Established in 2006, Cambopedia is the perfect blend of Cambodia and pedia, meaning learning. As a local Cambodian publisher and founder, I have a unique perspective on the country and its culture. I noticed a lack of resources written by locals, providing an opportunity to offer a new perspective on Cambodia.

While there are many travel blogs and websites that offer practical advice and tips, Cambopedia stands out with its local insights and perspectives. We believe that learning about Cambodia should be both informative and entertaining.

Our blog differs from others as we aim to provide a fresh perspective on Cambodia, not just focusing on the dark past of the infamous genocide and the Khmer Rouge. Instead, we aim to showcase the beauty, diversity, and richness of the country, making it an informative and entertaining read. Join us on this journey and rediscover Cambodia through a local lens.

Cambopedia is a local travel blog that offers travelers, expats, and citizens of the world a unique and authentic view of Cambodia. With a focus on providing insightful and entertaining information about the countryâ€™s people, culture, traditions, and everything in between, Cambopedia is your ultimate guide to Cambodia.
What sets Cambopedia apart?

What sets Cambopedia apart is that it is partially powered by AI technology, specifically the OpenAI ChatGPT model.
